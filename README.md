# Uotila for OSX

### Installation
1. `npm i -g uotila`
2. Go to System Preferences => Accessibility => Speech => System Voice => Customize... & search for `Cellos` (OSX doesn't ship with `Cellos` anymore, thx [@mpeltomaa](https://github.com/mpeltomaa) for pointing this out.)
3. Enjoy the song of my people from command line with `uotila`
